## Reason For Developement

Academic writing is fundamental to scholarly communication, serving as the primary means for disseminating research, ideas, and recommendations. Maintaining originality is paramount, and plagiarism detection software is widely used to ensure adherence to this principle before publication. While many institutions provide their faculty and students with access to these tools for self-assessment, this privilege remains unevenly distributed. A significant challenge arises from the inherent nature of academic research, which necessitates extensive reading of existing scholarly works, often the very sources where inadvertent plagiarism can occur. Therefore, implementing a system for self-assessment that specifically checks against these read papers could substantially mitigate the disparity between those with and without access to comprehensive plagiarism detection services.

## Description

Private Plagiarism Check is a client-side plagiarism detection tool built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to compare a single DOCX document against a user-provided database of PDF files. The database is created by processing each PDF file using Mozilla's PDF.js to extract all text for comparison. The DOCX file is converted to HTML using Mammoth.js to preserve its structure and layout, enabling accurate text extraction and presentation of results. This approach ensures that the original formatting of the DOCX document is reflected in the plagiarism report, enhancing the user's understanding of detected similarities.

The converted DOCX file is first transformed into HTML, which is then parsed into an array of objects. Each object corresponds to an HTML tag generated by Mammoth or a single-word string, split based on spaces. Every object contains at least three keys: id, tag, and content. This array is then further structured into an object with two arraysâ€”one for words and another for tags. Finally, this structured data, along with the PDF as a file buffer, is passed to a web worker for further processing, ensuring the user interface remains responsive.

Upon receiving the files, the web worker initiates the processing of the DOCX text by converting all content to lowercase and removing special characters to ensure consistency. The cleaned text is then segmented into an array of strings using a rolling window method applied incrementally. Simultaneously, a separate array is maintained to store the corresponding IDs of these strings in sequential order. To preserve data integrity, the array is checked for duplicates, and any redundant strings, along with their associated IDs, are removed.

Next, the system iterates through the provided PDF files, processing each file individually. During each iteration, the PDF text undergoes the same preprocessing steps as the DOCX text, including lowercase conversion, special character removal, and segmentation using the rolling window method to ensure consistency in string length. Each PDF file is then assigned a unique color from a predefined palette of 24 colors. The cleaned and segmented text from the PDF is subsequently compared against the DOCX text windows.

The comparison process involves matching the strings from the PDF array with those in the DOCX array. If a match meets or exceeds the predefined threshold, the corresponding ID is added to a set. This process continues iteratively until all DOCX text windows have been compared against the PDF text windows. Upon the successful processing of each PDF file, a progress update is sent to the main thread to reflect the real-time status of the process via the progress bar. This cycle repeats until all PDF files have been processed, after which the compiled set of matching IDs from all comparisons is returned to the main thread for final output.
